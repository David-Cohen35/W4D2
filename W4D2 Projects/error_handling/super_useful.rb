p feed_me_a_fruit
# Overview

# Sometimes when an error is thrown we would like to try the failing operation again (hopefully with different input :wink:). This is often the case with user input and text parsing. Let's try to make friendly monster happy by allowing us to retry feeding it a fruit when certain errors are thrown.

# Instructions

# Friendly monster is really friendly and really likes coffee, so he'd like to give us another try, but only when we give him "coffee".

# First, handle the errors being thrown by #reaction in #feed_me_a_fruit.

# Note that #reaction throws errors receiving an argument that is not in FRUITS. Next, let's differentiate the errors thrown so our calling function, #feed_me_a_fruit can try to feed friendly monster again, but only when they've given it coffee.

# Now that we have different error types being thrown by #reaction we can do a little conditional logic in #feed_me_a_fruit to retry the failing block of code again, but only if it is a coffee-related error.
